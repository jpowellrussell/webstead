What's with all the funny words here? I have striven to write with words, wherever I can, that come from Old English or other Germanish roots. While I strive to keep it out of your awareness where I can, sometimes that means that I talk about things slightly unlike you may see more often. Below I lay out why I do it and what to look for to help find the meaning behind things.

## Why The Weird Words

The first and weightiest ground for writing like this is that I like how it sounds. This way of writing was first brought to my knowledge by the short writing ["Uncleftish Beholding"](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/people/students/dtc/students2011/maitland/fun/) by Poul Anderson. This wonderful little work shows what writing about science might look like if we had come up with more words from Germanish roots for the things found out by carefully looking at the world rather than turning to Latin and Greek. The same author wrote a short story called ["The Tale of Hauk"](https://amzn.to/2Kr16Dg) written as far as he could only with words with Germanish roots. As it was about an almost-Viking, it somehow felt "right". From there I went on to find out about the works of [William Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barnes) and others who at one time or another have striven to turn English more toward its Germanish roots. All of these works gladdened me greatly, but for myself, I think that any work to take French, Latin, Greek, and other words wholly out of English is both doomed to not work and would make the tongue less wealthy to boot. That being said, I do find the work of looking for Germanish words oft makes me pick a more everyday word, and always makes me more aware of the roots and meanings of the words I pick. So, most of this webstead shows my work to speak more straightforwardly and find the roots of words as I write them.

## How Do You Pick What Words to Write

 For some words, like those for works of craft lately come up with, I write the word most oft said. For other words, where it would be truly murky what I meant, or else would take very many words to say where one word from other roots would do, I will go ahead and write that word. Also, sometimes I will forget, or put up work from before I started working at this way of writing. All of which is to say that sometimes I write words with Latin, Greek, French or other roots - my goal is not wholly unmingled English, but rather to see if I can get my meaning across openly within the bounds I've set for myself.  

## Men, Women, and All That

When I am talking about one, named man or woman, I will write "he" or "she", writing the one best liked by them as far as I know - do let me know if I get this wrong somewhere. When talking about a group, I will tend to write "folks". When talking about any man, woman, child, or whoever else, I'll write "them" to mean one being who belongs to mankind, as this seems to be the way that everyday folks have landed on that fits most cleanly with the tongue. All of this is to get around the troublesome Latin roots of "person" and "people", and that while "folks" works great for many, "folk" doesn't stand in cleanly for "person". So, when I say "men and women", no slight is meant to those folks who don't feel like they fall under that, and I keep away from putting things that way as much as I can. Likewise, my writing of "mankind" does not bring with it any lessening of women: in olden times, English had wermen and women (that "wer" is only still around in "werewolf" or the old law-word "weregild"), so "mankind" held both, and words like "headman" did not needfully mean a werman. I don't write new words like "zhi" and "zhim" and the like, for I have yet to find any that don't sound awful and fake to my ears, and it seems like we can find other ways to welcome folks and to acknowledge their worth without unlovely words.  

## Tools Leaned On

To learn how to write this way, I have found many tools handy. If you would like to learn more about such things, check these out:

- [*Plain English*](https://amzn.to/2YYabf8): I like this book so much I bought it twice (one for reading, one to cut the spine off and scan).  
- [*How We'd Talk if the English Won in 1066*](https://amzn.to/2H1vdzj):  
- ["Uncleftish Beholding"](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/people/students/dtc/students2011/maitland/fun/):  
- ["The Tale of Hauk"](https://amzn.to/2Kr16Dg):  
- [*The Anglish Moot*](https://anglish.fandom.com/wiki/Main_leaf):  
- Word Checker (Forthcoming): I have taken some of the word lists from the books above and put them onto my computer. Right now that means I can do a quick look-up of a word of not Germanish roots to find other words I might write instead. I'm teaching myself a bit of code so that I can build an add-on for a writing tool (right now I'm thinking VS Code) that will highlight words not of Germanish stock and bring up Germanish root words to write instead.
