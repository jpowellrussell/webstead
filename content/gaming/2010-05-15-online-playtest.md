So, with the revised conflict resolution rules settled as a starting point, I think it's time to take the leap and start playtesting. But my current environment is barren not only in water, but also gamers.  
  
So I'm going to give Google Wave a try for an online playtest of "The Book of Threes". If you're interested in participating, comment here or email me, and I'll set you up with a Wave account invite. I'm hoping to get the clan and character creation process kicked off sometime next week, depending on how quickly I can get together 4 or 5 folks.  
  
If you have any questions about what would be involved, how the online thing would work, or whatever, let me know.
