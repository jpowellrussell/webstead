[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see [here](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%%7D). Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]  
  
Today we get to the stuff I'm most excited about: the Chaos Cult and Intrigue generators! These are the parts that are most original and least a reworking of other people's stuff.  Obviously I think the reworking has value too, or I wouldn't be doing it, but coming up with these got me fired up in a way working on district write-ups or adapting the Powers that Be did not.   
  

So, a few words on each of the generators.  First of all, I can't help the feeling that they're overly simplistic, but I think in practice the complexity will come from interactions.  That being said, even more so than the other things, these are a draft, and I'd appreciate any suggestions for changes or additions. 
  

The intrigue generator essentially works as a mad libs.  If you don't already have a person or group in mind, you can randomly generate the players involved, or you can just roll the other columns and plug in the groups you want to find a relationship for.  The wants and beliefs are left fairly vague so they can fit a variety of different people and situations.  If an intrigue seems weak, either a) pick one you like better, b) roll again until something gets your motor going, or c) layer on other sources of complexity like generating specific NPCs, tying in the Powers that Be, pulling in a Chaos cult, or what have you. 
  

The Chaos cult generator's format is inspired by Logan Knight's excellent [NPC Birthing Sacs](http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/how-to-make-friends-and-imagine-people/).  I've added the feature that you can roll 1d4 and get a "standard" cult by reading straight across, and each cult is assumed to have an enmity/rivalry with the next one down.  Which Chaos God is generated does a lot of the heavy lifting for the flavor of the cult, as the rest of the columns were made to generically fit any one of the Chaos gods.  I figure I'll never be as evocative as the Realms of Chaos books, so I won't try.  I feel like the "quirks" could be more interesting, but it was hard to come up with ideas that worked equally well for followers of every ruinous power.  After the break is the actual rules.  ## Intrigue Generator  **Procedure** 
  - To find relationship between two people or groups, simply roll on
    column 2
  - To create a new basic intrigue, roll on columns 1, 2, and 3
  - To create an intermediate intrigue, add column 4
  - To create a complex intrigue, add column 5
  - For maximum complexity, add column 6
  - Repeat the process with already established groups or people in one
    or more columns in order to create a web of conflicting and
    interconnecting plots
  - If the same group or person comes up in multiple columns, attempt to
    interpret it in a way that makes sense, such as a smaller factions
    within a larger group, or complex internal psychology of an
    individual, but if it flat out does not work, re-roll
  - If using column 6, try to interpret the other columns in light of
    the district rumor to create a coherent whole
  - Finally, the headings can be used as an ad lib to be filled in any
    way you like: "(Person/Group) wants (a thing) from (Person/Group)
    because of a lack of (a thing) that they blame on (Person/Group)
    because they are secretly behind (a random rumor) in (a random
    district)."

## Chaos Cult Generator  **Procedure** 
  - Step 1: Roll on the table
  - Step 2: Adapt the name as necessary (such as by adding "The
    Brotherhood of" or "The ____ Order" or the like) 
  - Step 3: Determine size of the cult by rolling 2d6, with 6's
    "exploding" (roll again and add on any 6's) to find the number of
    members
  - Step 4: Find at least one Chaos Cult to be an enemy or rival
  - For a quick cult, roll 1d4 and read straight across for step 1, and
    for step 4, use the next cult down in the table (wrapping around for
    Nurgle)
  - For a more involved cult, roll 1 each of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and a
    d20
  - Optional: For more involved goals, roll twice each for short and
    long term goals and use the first roll to determine the verb from
    and the other roll for the object
  - Optional: Plug the newly created cult into columns 1, 3, or 5 of the
    intrigue generator and create one or more plots for the cult to be
    involved in that may or may not relate to their short and long term
    goals
  - Optional: Use the NPC generator to create any members of the cult as
    they are needed
