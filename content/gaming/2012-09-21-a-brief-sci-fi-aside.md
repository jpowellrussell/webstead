So, I read through Grognardia's [review](http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2012/09/retrospective-warhammer-40000-rogue.html) of Warhammer 40,000, Rogue Trader, and it made me realize something. My design meant to take Necromunda in a slightly more role-play-ey direction was in fact taking 40k back to its roots in Rogue Trader. Now, I think that I can make some more interesting and balanced game design decisions, but overall, Rogue Trader was originally created to address the design space I was shooting for: small skirmish groups based on flavor, with an Arbitrator making it easier to have complex scenarios. I'm going to give the rogue trader rules a gander and see what's different from the 2nd Edition 40k and Skirmish rules I grew up with versus how I want to design my version of the rules.
