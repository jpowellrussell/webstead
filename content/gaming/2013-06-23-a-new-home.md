So, I realized how much I was using Google+ and how frustrating it was to comment on blogs awkwardly with my wordpress account.  So, here I am on blogspot.  I'm still making tweaks to the layout, but otherwise, things should continue the same, but now with easier integration with Google+ (Which is where most of my traffic comes from anyway).
