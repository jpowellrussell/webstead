One of the things I want to develop for [Heresies Without Number](http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/HWN)Â is a set of equipment packages by career. So, in other words, if you choose "Arbitrator" for a career, you get a stack of equipment to go with it that makes sense. These will hopefully be coming soon, but as a step in my process of figuring out what gear to include, I realized I wanted to be able to compare and manipulate my source equipment lists - [Stars Without Number](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition), [Dark Heresy](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/65872/Dark-Heresy-Core-Rulebook), and [Warband!](http://swordplusone.blogspot.com/2014/04/warband.html) 
  

Having gone through the process of cleaning this text up into a useful table form (all except warband, which copied over as a true table with no work from me, God bless you, Mike Davison) I figured I'd share the fruits of my labor in case anybody wants to use it as inputs to something like Logan's [Generator Generator](http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/) (I may come up with a random equipment table for NPCs later). 
  

So here's the table, go nuts:
