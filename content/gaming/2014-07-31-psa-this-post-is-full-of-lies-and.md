 [UPDATE: February 12th, 2019: Given [Mandy Morbid's claims about Zak](https://dungeonsdonuts.tumblr.com/post/182722330779/mandy-morbid-comes-forward-about-zak-s-violence) and [Patrick Stuart's substantiation of their likelihood](http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2019/02/you-should-read-this.html), I no longer feel comfortable with a public post of support, but in the interest of transparency, I am not removing it. According to Mandy, the post linked below supposedly by her was actually penned by Zak, and is now inconsistent with what she supports. I have no idea if the Failforward piece is lying or not, but IÂ  maintain my belief that the use of "kafkatrapping" is corrosive and wrong, so I continue to endorse that piece of this post. Feel free to contact me with any questions or to comment below if you'd like to learn more about my feelings on the matter.]  
  
<s>So, I don't have much time to comment on this, but this post from Failforward is chock full of lies, misinformation, and other untrue things. I don't know enough about the author to speak to intent, but it sucks. Read it only as a lesson in how not to make a point or as a lesson in how to destroy your own credibility.</s>   <s>   </s>[<s>http://failforward.co.uk/post/93348768153/how-dungeons-and-dragons-is-endorsing-the-darkest-parts</s>](http://failforward.co.uk/post/93348768153/how-dungeons-and-dragons-is-endorsing-the-darkest-parts)   <s>   As an antidote to it, I post an earlier blog entry by Mandy Morbid, girlfriend to the Zak S mentioned in the first (lying, terrible) post and a more recent one spurred by the response to the terrible, lying Failforward post:</s>   <s>   </s>[<s>http://mandymorbid.tumblr.com/post/92910013775/more-reasons-people-found-to-hate-me</s>](http://mandymorbid.tumblr.com/post/92910013775/more-reasons-people-found-to-hate-me)   <s>   </s>[<s>http://mandymorbid.tumblr.com/post/93368940635/people-who-hate-me-part-2</s>](http://mandymorbid.tumblr.com/post/93368940635/people-who-hate-me-part-2)   <s>   </s>Finally, for an explanation of why the methods of faux-argumentation used in the (terrible, lying, and as far as I can tell wrong) Failforward article would be bad even if the article were right, here's a nice essay by Eric S. Raymond on disingenuous rhetorical techniques that use someone's assertion of innocence as evidence if their guilt:
