These are the tables I use for running [Crapsack Goblins](http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/search/label/Crapsack%20Goblins), so I wanted to have one page I could open during the game and click on links to make things happen. These links were created with Logan Knight's [totally sweet do it yourself random generator generator](http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/generators/choose-your-own-generator/).
