Following up my general thrust post on the adventuring company setting/game thing I’m working on, here’s the working table of contents for what I’m planning to write, with some initial indication of organization. I have a few questions about this that would be helpful to get answers for:  **   **  1\. Does this look like something cool? Would anyone besides me get any use out of this?  2\. Has too much of this already been done too well to be worth repeating? (If so, what and where can I find it?)  3\. What am I missing?  **   **  Now, if nobody chimes in on the questions, I’ll just chug along for my own self, but I’d love to hear some outside opinions. The idea is that each of line of the TOC is a relatively discrete chunk that can be used or replaced at will without affecting the other pieces. Anyway, here’s the current table of contents:  **   **  Setting Creation   Hex Map Terrain Generation  Creating General Features  Placing Sites of Interest   Creating Sites of Interest  Creating Villages/Settlements  Placing Villages/Settlements  Determining Amount of Treasure   Placing Treasure  Creating Rumors  Creating Weather  Creating Disease  Creating Random Encounters by terrain  Creating Creatures/Monsters  **   **  Factions  Faction Characteristics  Creating factions  Populating map with factions  Off-screen faction interaction  **   **  Company Creation  Company characteristics  Creation of Companies  Types of Characters (Officers, henchmen, etc)  Equipment for Companies  Companies run by 1 player  Companies run by multiple players  **   **  Colonies/Base Camps  Creation of Base Camp/Colony  Types of Resources  Conversion of resources to treasure/money  Colony Features/Assets - including defenses  Buying/Building Assets  Expanding/Improving Colony  Colony Inhabitants and growth  Supplies/Provisions  Starvation and Deprivation  **   **  Expeditions  Supplies, Encumbrance, Speed  Travel Rolls  Encounter Rolls  Reactions  Mass Combat  Significant Location Mission Rolls  Death/injury/recovery  Recovering Treasure  **   **  Managing a Company  Payment & Upkeep  Recruiting new members  Experience for henchmen  New skills/abilities for henchmen  Experience and new skills/abilities for officers  Converting Treasure to Gold/Assets/Other stuff  Sending treasure home/taxes  **   **  Variations and Example Combinations  Minimum abstraction for traditional D&D campaign  Medium Abstraction for Company Play D&D campaign  Maximum Abstraction Competitive/Solitaire Game  Turns & Turn Structure  Win Conditions  **   **  Conversion  How to convert between D&D and other games (especially Mordheim)  **   **  Example Setting   Rumors  Weather  Disease  General Features  Random Encounters by terrain type  Native Village/Settlement tables  Creatures/Monsters  Sites of Interest (~10, ½ - 3 pages each)  Map
