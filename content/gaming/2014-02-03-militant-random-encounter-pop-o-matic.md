So, as inspired by some of the [random](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-jade-fang-of-tiamat.html) [encounters](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-pale-eye-of-tiamat.html) [over](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-cobalt-claw-of-tiamat.html) [at](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-red-hand-of-tiamat.html) [Playing D&D with Pornstars](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-black-wing-of-tiamat.html), here is a random encounter generator for patrols from the more militant sort of opponents.  Specifically, in Fellhold, I'm using this for random encounters with hobgoblin and human gang member patrols.  My party still tore through one of these with a well-timed sleep spell and judicious application of axes.  Now they're trying to decide whether to charm or murder the sleeping hobgoblins and where to go from there, so I'd say mission = success.  Best used with a [polyhedral Pop-o-Matic](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-get-d-dice-in-pop-o-matic-bubble.html?zx=363fc14e39ead536).  This skews a little high for encounters for lower level parties, so feel free to adjust as necessary:  
  
1d4: Level of Foot Soldiers   1d6: Level of Leader   1d8: Number of Foot Soldiers   1d10: Replace one Foot Soldier with Magic-User if 9 or 0   1d12: \# of Doom points if a magic-user is present   1d20: If 16+, roll a random treasure  
  
Points that need addressing to use in play:  
  

  - What species?
  - What level is the spell caster, and thus how many of what level
    spells? (If you don't use doom points, try doing 1-4: Level 1, 5-8:
    Level 2, 9-12: Level 3)
  - What random treasure table to roll on? I recommend either 1
    "treasure unit" from Courtney Campbell's [treasure
    supplement](http://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2010/11/treasure-update.html?showComment=1297033347426#c573327039026533339)
    or else just decide based on circumstances
