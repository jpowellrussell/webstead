I didn't grow up with Harryhausen the way a lot of the folks into this Old School stuff did, but I certainly love and appreciate his work.  And that's why I think that [the idea to make Friday an OSR blogfest](http://gamersandgrognards.blogspot.com/2013/05/rip-ray-harryhausen-way-to-honor-him.html) in honor of the late, great Ray Harryhausen is a fantastic one.  So spread the word and tune in.
