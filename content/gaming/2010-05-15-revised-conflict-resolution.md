Well, after thinking about the issues raised in Conflict Resolution Conflict, I've come to what I think is a workable starting point for moving forward with the core resolution rules for "The Book of Threes".  
  
I decided to go with letting both sides put forward a set number of dice, and for that number to be equal to the leader's current Wealth score. This gives wealth something to do as a static value, and ties it directly into conflict resolution, so now all three resources have something to do in conflict.  
  
You can find the revised conflict resolution rules here: [Revised Conflict Resolution](http://dicegods.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/conflict-resolution-2.doc)  
  
**ed:** the main playtest document now contains this updated section in place of the old one. It was crap anyway. But I've left this separate document up for easier reference of the first major change since posting the rules.
