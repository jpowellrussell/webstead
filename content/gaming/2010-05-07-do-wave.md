So, in a comment to a previous entry, Joon Phil mentioned this [article](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/10/google-wave-we-came-we-saw-we-played-dd.ars). It highlights the uses of Google Wave as an online roleplaying venue. I've applied for an invitation to start using wave, because I want to check it out. If anyone else is interested, you can request an invite [here](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/closed.html). I'm considering using it to playtest "The Book of Threes" down the road a bit, and I'm always hungry for as much roleplaying as I can get my hands on, so I think this might help.
