 <http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/8680/Seattle_Underground.jpg>  So, I've been working on rebooting my homebrew campaign setting for a while now, just letting thoughts percolate, challenging myself to get creative, and I think something clicked when I went on the Seattle Underground tour. 
  
As a sneak peak, here's the new Fellhold in [25 words or less](http://mbenign.blogspot.com/2009/03/wohoon-in-less-than-10-words.html):  
  
**Endless forest, Germanic dwarves, falling lich empire, Pacific Northwest, pioneers, crapsack, city, demons, witches, brick, dynamite, warrior lodges, feuds, ratmen, wendigos, tides, totem poles, godsâ€™ bones.**
