The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see [here](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%%7D). Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.] 
  

So, first off, "[The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/117258/The-Seclusium-of-Orphone-of-the-Three-Visions?term=seclusium)", if you're not aware, is a new adventure/supplement/thing by D. Vincent Baker for use with Lamentations of the Flame Princess and other old school D&D and D&D-like games.  It is a step-by-step guide to creating a funky wizard's tower in the tradition of Jack Vance, especially the Dying Earth and Lyonnesse.  It does a wonderful job of evoking that source material and is chock full of imaginative stuff. 
  

The process is a good spur to the imagination, but Zak Smith mentioned in his [review](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2013/07/quick-seclusium-of-orphone-review.html), and I agreed, that a good worksheet would help organize the process and make it more usable.  It turned out that more like 4+ worksheets were needed, but here they are:

Let me know if you find them useful and any suggestions for improvements, as these are a pretty rough.
