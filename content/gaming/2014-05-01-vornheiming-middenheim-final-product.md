[UPDATE 2/12/19: I no longer support spending money on products that benefit Zak S, or giving him positive attention and connection. The short version is that I find credible claims that he has engaged in unacceptable behavior and not made up for it. For more detail, see [here](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D%7B%%20post_url%202019-02-12-removing-support-from-zak-smith%20%%7D). Please consider these claims and make your own decision on their validity, and the implications thereof, before supporting Zak in any way.]

So, here it is, the final Middenheim booklet. At least, as final as I'm planning on making it at this point. And only 5 months in the making! The good news is that I get to pretend I intended for it to be part of [+Mike Evans](https://plus.google.com/104780290634286531079) 's "DIY Month".  
  

I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and I certainly learned a lot in efficiency, layout, and overall information design. Still, since I'm not a pro, and because I want people to be able to easily modify and riff off of this, I've also included a link to a Google Docs text only version, the tables as Google Sheets, and a zip file of the indesign book along with linked images. For more info, check out the permanent page I've created for Middenheim. 
  

It's designed to be printed out on letter sized paper (sorry European friends, you'll have to scale/edit for A4) with two pages per sheet, and then folded over to create a half-letter sized booklet. For my own personal use I've printed off a cardstock cover and heavy weight interior paper. It made the folding and stabling a little harder, but it looks pretty sharp, and it's nice having a finished product in my hands that I made myself. With regular printer paper, the booklet works out just fine, though you may want to trim to clean up the edge. 
  

As for what's actually there, the content is mostly the same as previous posts, but with the wording cleaned up and often trimmed to fit into the layout constraints. The artwork is almost all Russ Nicholson and almost all from the original book (some is from Marienburg). As mentioned in the "Special Thanks" section, if any of the creators or rights-holders have a problem with the use of their material, I humbly request they let me know and I will immediately take down the file. 
  

Any and all feedback on content, layout, presentation, et cetera is welcome. Most importantly, enjoy!
