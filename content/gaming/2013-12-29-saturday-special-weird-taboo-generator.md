*[edit: it's Sunday, not Saturday]*   *   *Reading Arnold K's [totally sweet post about Wizards and Witches](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/12/sister-witches-and-monastic-wizards.html) inspired me to try to come up with a way to think up bizarre taboos for wizards and monastic types on the fly.  I imagine some of them will take more interpreting than others, but let's try it out!  
  
Here's the table:    <table> <tbody> <tr class="odd"> <td>d2</td> <td>Mood</td> <td>d4</td> <td>Degree</td> <td>d6</td> <td>Time</td> <td>d8</td> <td>Verb</td> <td>d10</td> <td>Noun</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td>1</td> <td>Must</td> <td>1</td> <td>In moderation</td> <td>1</td> <td>Always</td> <td>1</td> <td>Eat</td> <td>1</td> <td>Meat</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td>2</td> <td>Should</td> <td>2</td> <td>In excess</td> <td>2</td> <td>Never</td> <td>2</td> <td>Drink</td> <td>2</td> <td>Slaves</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td></td> <td></td> <td>3</td> <td>At all</td> <td>3</td> <td>In the presence of others</td> <td>3</td> <td>Use</td> <td>3</td> <td>Alcohol</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td></td> <td></td> <td>4</td> <td>In vain</td> <td>4</td> <td>Between sunrise and sunset</td> <td>4</td> <td>Own</td> <td>4</td> <td>Sex</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>5</td> <td>Between sunset and sunrise</td> <td>5</td> <td>Abstain from</td> <td>5</td> <td>Words</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>6</td> <td>Every day</td> <td>6</td> <td>Tolerate</td> <td>6</td> <td>Violence</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>7</td> <td>See</td> <td>7</td> <td>Blood</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>8</td> <td>Speak with</td> <td>8</td> <td>Vegetables</td> </tr> <tr class="even"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>9</td> <td>Pets</td> </tr> <tr class="odd"> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>10</td> <td>Opposite Sex</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
  

And let's try a few examples: 
  - (Roll: 1, 4, 2, 6, 4) Must never tolerate sex in vain (I see this as
    a belief that sex is a necessary evil for making babies and
    followers of this belief would be intolerable prudes)
  - (Roll: 1, 4, 3, 8, 7) Must speak with blood in the presence of
    others in vain (Okay, this one's weird. Maybe when in the presence
    of others, these people must address people based on their social
    class, or something weird and magical with blood?)
  - (Roll: 2, 2, 6, 7, 1) Should see meat in excess every day (These
    guys would have to surround themselves with raw meat, more than they
    can eat)

It's not perfect, but I think it might be fun if you're stuck for ideas.
