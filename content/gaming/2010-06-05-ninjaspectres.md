So, as previously mentioned, I got excited about making a Ninja Burger + InSpectres hack, and after noodling around with it, discovered it didn't take much to do at all!  
  
So [here](http://dicegods.wordpress.com/games/ninjaspectres/) it is.  
  
Let me know what you think (this is as yet unplaytested, but considering it comes from two games that work fine and are playtested, I assume it'll be fine. I may make changes once I get the chance to play it some).
