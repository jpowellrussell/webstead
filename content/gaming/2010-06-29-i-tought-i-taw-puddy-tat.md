Yes, a tweety bird joke because I have grown week and gotten a twitter account. I mostly got it to play [Echo Bazaar](http://echobazaar.failbettergames.com/), a browser based game set in a surreal and fantastic Victorian London, for which Mr. Vincent Baker and Mr. John Harper are working on an Apocalypse World Hack, the snippets of which were tantalizing. At any rate, I'll probably also use it to post quick thoughts and updates regarding the site and game design and such. Probably picking up in traffic after I get back to America and have a cell phone again.
