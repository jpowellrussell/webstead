I'm going to be taking a bit of a break from my starter RPG project for two main reasons. First off, I've found a wealth of games I'd really enjoy to run, some of which I think would make good introductions to what roleplaying is for adult, non-gamer type people. But secondly, I still take the starter RPG notion seriously, but I realized that paradoxically, an RPG designed for beginning players should *not* be my first full-fledged RPG design. I should maybe know what I'm doing before I tackle that.  
  
Also.  
  
I had an idea for another game that is now consuming every ounce of my game design juices (okay, a few ounces are spared for stray thoughts). I am channeling the bad shit, here. I've filled out a whole notebook, and I take it's replacement everywhere I go. I wake up in the middle of the night with ideas. Talking about it at this point would probably solidify some things that are still better off nebulous as I work them together, though. That being said, as a "sneak preview", here's a recommended reading list for the setting/color:  
  
(In roughly descending order of relevance)   
- Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander
- Beowulf
- The Poetic and Prose Eddas
- The Mabinogion
- The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer
- A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin
- The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper
- Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock
- The Volsunga Saga trans. by J.R.R. Tolkien
- The Lord of the Rings
- Various Irish Myths and Legends

  
Hopefully that gives you a pretty good idea of the 'flavor' I'm going for, but I hope you'll be pleasantly surprised by what I come up with for rules.
