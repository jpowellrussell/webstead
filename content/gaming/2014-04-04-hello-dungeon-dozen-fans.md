Howdy folks. If you've stopped by the front page here from my [Dungeon Dozen Fan Index](http://blessingsofthedicegods.blogspot.com/p/dungeon-dozen-fan-index.html), then you'll notice it's been a bit since I've updated the blog here. Rest assured the index has taken a higher priority as a matter of community service than my own blatherings. Â That being said, I'm starting to ramp up a bit again in thinking and writing about RPGs, and if you have seen the Middenheim posts here, I'm working on the final .pdf as I get the time. So, thanks for stopping by, and I hope you'll check in as I start posting again.  
  
*Update: Buy the [Dungeon Dozen Book](http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?contributorId=1209443)!*
