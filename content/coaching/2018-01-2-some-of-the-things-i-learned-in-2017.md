One of the most important habits I have been building over the past couple years has been to be more deliberate in my reflection. So I wanted to close out this year with an inventory of what I’ve learned, both to solidify it and to figure out where I might spend my efforts next year. To figure out how to structure such a list, I turned to my daily practice modeled on the one suggested by [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/), but with a few additions. These are the areas of my life I have defined as important enough that I need to learn and grow in them every day, so it makes sense to reflect on them here at year end. This list is certainly not exhaustive, but hopefully captures some of the most important lessons.
