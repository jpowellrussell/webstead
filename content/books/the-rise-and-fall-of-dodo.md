**By Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland**

Neal Stephenson is probably my favorite living author, and so I buy anything with his name on it no questions asked. I tore through this on my recent flight to Beijing and rather enjoyed it. A shadowy government organization discovers that magic used to be real but doesn't work anymore, and then figures out a way to make it work again to send people back in time. A fun read that touches on all of the exciting possibilities of magic, time travel, and quantum physics. Not as many detailed asides as a pure Stephenson book, but that means that it keeps moving at a brisk pace the whole time. Give it a shot if the idea of mashing up fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction gets you all hot and bothered.
