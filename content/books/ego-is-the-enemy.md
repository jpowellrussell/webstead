**By Ryan Holiday**

Ryan Holiday has been behind a lot of what I've talked about here and a lot of the links I've shared, but I haven't called him out explicitly yet. He's a modern day exponent of an ancient philosophy, and though my interest in stoicism predates my exposure to Holiday, I have found his works useful and engaging. He's best known for _[The Obstacle is the Way](http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&id=958eeb71ed&e=a21731beeb),_ which has been hugely influential with top performers from the business world to the NFL, but I have found this book more useful personally. It is a systematic analysis of how prone we all are to excessive self regard and the ways that destroys you - whether you are aspiring, achieving, or failing.Â Ego also hinders true creativity because it stops you from the real work you need to push limits and discover new frontiers.
