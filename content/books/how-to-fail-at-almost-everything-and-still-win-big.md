**By Scott Adams**

The core thesis of this book is that [goals are for losers, systems are for winners, and passion is bullshit](http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&id=8e5461f8de&e=a21731beeb). When I finally got around to actually reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it absolutely _jam packed_Â with useful little nuggets. Seriously, this is one of the highest "actionable stuff to fluff" self-improvement books I've ever read. While it is full of specific tactics, the real value of this book is how it points out the complex system that leads to your energy, output, and ultimately success.
