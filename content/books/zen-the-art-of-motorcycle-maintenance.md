**By Robert Pirsig**

Despite my initially somewhat negative reaction to this book, it has become one of my "[operating manuals](https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life)" for life. Even when I first read it and disagreed with much of what it said, I found a lot of compelling food for thought. Paradoxically, the very thing that made me uncomfortable initially has become its greatest value to me: the questioning of received ideas of values and building new ones up from scratch. A fascinating look at depth, focus, and quality.Â
