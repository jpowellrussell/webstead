**By Will Eisner**

Written by a giant of the sequential art field, this book covers the insights from decades of creating and teaching about the use of comics to tell stories. Eisner defends and establishes the usefulness and seriousness of the form as a literary medium, capable of addressing themes and issues that matter. The central tenet of the book is that the visuals must be shaped by the needs of the story and not the other way around - otherwise you get lured into meaningless set pieces that serve no purpose but to show off something that looks good. It covers a lot of the same ground as the other works we've discussed on Storytelling, but does so with beautiful illustrations (duh) and a very different focus than works addressed primarily to crafters of prose.
