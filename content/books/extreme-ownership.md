This one is not explicitly about creativity, but I think you'll find it more helpful in that respect than you might think at first glance. Written by a pair of Navy SEAL officers who served together in Ramadi, Iraq when it was at its worst, this book lays out deceptively simple principles for effective leadership. I say deceptive because simple does not mean easy. Following the straightforward advice is much harder than understanding it. Which brings us to creativity: this book's advice on building discipline will help you immensely in building the habits you need for quality creativity. If you want to get a taste, or if you read the book and can't get enough, check out the [Jocko Podcast](http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&id=d5e1e97557&e=a21731beeb).
