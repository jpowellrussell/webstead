**By Nassim Taleb**

The core concept explored in this book is what is "risk" and how should we think about it in our lives, but it reaches out and touches so many more areas of interest. Taleb is shockingly smart, enjoyably contrarian, and writes in a very engaging way. This book is one of my top five life and brain changing books - you will be a little bit smarter every time you read it.

Check out the posts I wrote about this book [here](https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/6/9/rethinking-risk-with-antifragile) and [here](https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/6/16/fragility-robustness-and-antifragility).
