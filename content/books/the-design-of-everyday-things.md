**By Don Norman**

This book came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine at work and it certainly did not disappoint. It focuses on questions of how objects in our environment can enhance (or detract) from our experience and our lives. Most useful to me was the distinction between _affordances_ and _signifiers_ and the notion of "knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world." If you're even a little bit interested in how the objects, structures, and organizations around you shape your life in subtle ways, you'll thoroughly enjoy this.
