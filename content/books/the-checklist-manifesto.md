**By Atul Gawande**

I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but to be perfectly honest, I was worried it was one of those books where if you know the premise you don't need to read it. What I had overlooked is the degree to which making the case for checklists would motivate me to actually change my behavior. The examples given of lives saved and fortunes made through the seemingly simple expedient of using checklists are quite impressive. Plus, there's a neat checklist for creating your own checklist in the back.  
  
If you want to up your game to true professionalism in just about any field, check out this book.Â
