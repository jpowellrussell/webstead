**By Steven Pressfield**

We've talked before about _War of Art_ and it's discussion of Resistance, the force within us that stops us from creating and achieving what we might. Well, Turning Pro is Pressfield's "how to" on overcoming that force, and it mostly comes down to doggedly showing up to do the work every day, regardless of how inspired you're feeling. While I find _War of Art_ more inspirational overall, this work is a great companion that gives you concrete steps of what to do when you commit to following the advice in WoA.
