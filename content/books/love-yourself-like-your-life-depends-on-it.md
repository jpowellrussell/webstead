This one didn't _quite_ make it on to my [list of operating manuals](https://www.jeffrussellcoaching.com/coaching-blog/2017/7/14/my-operating-manuals-for-life), in part because I just finished it a week or two ago and I'm not sure how much of an impact it's had on me yet. It might sound hopelessly like positive thinking hippy dippy crap, but I've been getting more and more convinced about the power of auto-suggestion, in part because of the Scott Adams [persuasion reading list](http://jeffrussellcoaching.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=df2d4a2d24de687c5851d6fb7&id=08b4705a3e&e=a21731beeb) I've mentioned before. So I'm giving the approaches recommended in this book a good, honest try before I either dismiss it or sing its praises. If you do the same, let me know how it works out for you.

Buy it [here](https://smile.amazon.com/Love-Yourself-Like-Your-Depends-ebook/dp/B0086BX8UE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1507241184&sr=1-1&keywords=love+yourself+like+your+life+depends+on+it).
