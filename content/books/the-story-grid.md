This book has been on my list for a long time, but I only just now got around to reading it, and man was I missing out! It breaks down the mysterious art of writing a story that "works" into comprehensible and testable steps. That's what I think is most remarkable about this book: not that it tells you the components of a story that works (we've been getting that since Aristotle), but that it gives you tools to tighten up the feedback loop on your stories - you can evaluate your success or failure and make adjustments using these tools. You still have to put in the work and get inspired by the Muse, but all of the guesswork is removed. It has a really strong emphasis on writing fiction, but the lessons are applicable to any sort of storytelling.
