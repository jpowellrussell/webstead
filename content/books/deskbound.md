By now, you've probably heard about how bad sitting is for you, and maybe you've even seen or used a standing desk somewhere. Well, this book lays down the case for why sitting is _literally_ killing us in stark, terrifying detail, and proceeds to provide specific, step by step instructions on how to do something about it. It's not as simple as buying a standing desk and burning your chair - you have to re-teach your body appropriate ways of moving after years oflearning the wrong thing. Fortunately, the prescriptions in this book are easy to follow and will give you immediate relief as well as long-lasting solutions to problems like stiff backs, joint pain, and chronic stress.
