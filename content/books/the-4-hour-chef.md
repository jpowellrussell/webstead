**By Tim Ferriss**

Besides being a phenomenal "learn to cook from nothing" cookbook, this also actually a book on how to learn _anything._Â Meta-learning is like catnip to me, and I was already a huge Tim Ferriss fan when this came out, so I snapped it right up. Apparently it hasn't done as well as his other books and it was dealing with it's rough release that led him to start his podcast. I was shocked to learn this, because to me it was more of what I had gotten in _The 4 Hour Workweek_ and _The 4 Hour Body_, but better refined and figured out. The frameworks in this book are invaluable companions to other "how to learn" frameworks like Scott Young and Cal Newport. Even if you're already a master cook, check this book out for it's advice on how to deconstruct a skill and ask experts the right questions to fast track insights and skills.
