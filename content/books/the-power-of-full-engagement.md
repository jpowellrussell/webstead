**By Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz**

I started reading this book because I've encountered the idea of managing "energy" in several places, and I wanted an adequate description to work with. This book did not disappoint. As I read, I kept thinking "this reminds me of Josh Waitzkin's advice in The Art of Learning, so I went back and checked, and sure enough, he trained with the authors. While the physical and emotional energy stuff is useful, I found this work's definition of "spiritual" as "caring about something larger than yourself beyond your own self-interest" to be the most straightforward and practical definition I've encountered. A lot of ideas from this book have been incorporated elsewhere, but it's full of specific case studies and examples of how the concepts have been applied in a variety of situations. Great stuff.
