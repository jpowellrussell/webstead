**By Edward de Bono**

I mentioned this book in the previous posts on creativity, but it didn't get its own spotlight yet. It's a classic in the realm of creativity, and a lot of what has been developed since builds on its solid foundation. It takes an extremely practical approach by recommending various exercises a teacher might assign students to encourage and develop lateral thinking, but these are just as easily self-imposed by those of us lacking adult supervision. My very favorite takeaway from this book is the idea that sometimes to get to a good idea, you _have_Â to go through a bad idea first.

If you like this sort of thing, check out my posts on creativity.
