**By Lt. Col. Dave Grossman**

This book might seem out of left field for those of you outside of the military or law enforcement, but I think it has several valuable lessons for everybody. First off, it will help you to understand many of the dynamics going on -Â on both sides - of the deadly force encounters you hear about in the news. Secondly, it's breakdown of the physical, psychological, and environmental factors of the most extreme kind of stress can be reverse-engineered to the more mild kinds of stress most of us are lucky enough to deal with. Finally, it just might help you prepare for unlikely but terrible life-threatening situations.
