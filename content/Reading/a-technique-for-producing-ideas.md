**By James Webb Young**

This book might be the best "bang for the buck" I've ever seen - at 42 pages, you can easily read it in an evening and almost every single page is chock full of useful, actionable tips. It lays out the steps to follow in order to generate new, creative ideas. While it lacks some of the concepts we go through in our creativity series, it easily integrates with them. Do yourself a favor and check this out.
