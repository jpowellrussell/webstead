# KHS Series Part 1: Bringing In New Knowledge

## Opening

### This is all about input

By definition, to learn, you have to find stuff you don't already know.
This post is all about that step. Clearly that's not all there is to
learning, but it lays the groundwork for the other steps we'll talk
about in this series. For me, the main thing to keep in mind for input
is "Garbage In, Garbage Out" - if you don't start with worthwhile stuff,
you won't learn deep, meaningful things. In this post we're going to
look at ways of working that will help you find, sift, and work through
inputs for a wide range of learning undertakings.

### Try lots of things

I'm going to talk about a lot of ways to find, sift, and work through
input, and there are even more that I won't be talking about. At this
step, and throughout this series, remember that different folks really
do
[think](https://web.archive.org/web/20200531145855/https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/)
and [learn](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8558) very differently, so the key
is to try a lot of things and take heed of what works for you and what
doesn't.

### Keep what works for you

Once you've given a lot of things a go, keep what works for you and get
rid of what doesn't. You are likely to get fired up by some way of
working, go at it hammer and tongs for a while, and then fall off after
a bit. If you're like me, right from word go, you'll be tempted to build
an end-to-end set-up that takes care of every little thing that might
ever happen someday. Shove that feeling aside and start with "small" and
"good enough". As Tim Ferriss says, the [okay thing you stick with is
better than the perfect thing you give
up](https://smile.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers-ebook/dp/B01HSMRWNU/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tools+of+titans&qid=1593728585&sr=8-1).
Let your set-up grow over time by adding a bit here, tweaking a bit
there, always keeping in mind what you'll truly keep up.

## Finding Things that Might Be Worthwhile

To bring in new knowledge, we first have to find the raw inputs to
learn. I like to think about two main variables in finding knowledge
inputs: newness and worth. By newness, I mean *new to you*. You want to
find things that are new enough to help you learn what you don't already
know, but not so new that you can't understand them. For worth, you want
to find things that are not only fun to learn, but that will
meaningfully help you in your life - there's too much stuff out there to
learn to spend too much time on stuff that won't help you. My rules of
thumb for finding good stuff are to get trusted folks to recommend
things, follow links from works I've liked, and to build in the
unlooked-for.

### Trusted Recommendations

This is likely the way I most often find worthwhile inputs. Trusted
recommendations can come in a few flavors: getting the name of a book
from a friend while talking, reading a review by someone you follow
online, or even treating every new work by some writers as a "must
read". I like to rank sources of recommendations like this:

1.  *Very Best*: Someone you truly know (like a friend), like well, and
    share many views with
2.  *Next Best*: Someone you "know" (like a blogger you've been reading
    for years), think well of, and share some views with
3.  *Still Pretty Good*: Someone whose views are clearly put forth and
    you know pretty well, but you don't wholly agree with - you won't
    always go with what they recommend, but you'll have a good idea
    about whether you'll like it or not based on your differences with
    them
4.  *Not So Good*: What's popular, what's high status, what has a
    credential attached to it - none of these things are bad, but by
    themselves they won't steer you to what's most helpful for you

### Following Links

For this way of going about things, you need something or someone
worthwhile to start with, and then look for what paths it shows you. The
old school way is to check out the bibliography of a book (Ryan Holiday
has a [good
article](https://ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/)
on reading where one of his rules is to try to always read one book from
the bibliography of a good book). When you're really jazzed about a
particular topic, it's easy to want to read every book in a
bibliography. Unless you want to make the topic your life's work,
though, you're likely better off keeping yourself to one or two, maybe a
handful at most. You can always come back later, if it *does* become
your life's work.

Next is to check out author interviews or recommended reading lists.
This is a super common question for authors to get, so if you read a
book by an author and like how they think, just search for "\[author
name\] book recommendations". Nassim Taleb has a rather [hefty
list](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/72773.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb_Book_Recommendations)
helpfully put together over at Good Reads. Ryan Holiday sends out a
[monthly newsletter](https://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/) with
his recommendations. This blurs a little bit with "trusted
recommendations" above, but I thought was worth calling out on its own.

Next, you can do a "backwards bibliography" with a forward
citation/cited by search. Services like [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) can do this for you, though it
works better for academic papers than for books. A search like this
takes a book or paper and then tells you what later books/papers listed
it as a source. This is great not only for following an interesting
chain of research or reasoning to see how much farther it's been taken,
but also to see if anyone has found contradictory evidence or failed to
replicate research.

### Building In the Unlooked-For

The first two ways are your meat and potatoes of finding new knowledge
inputs, but you might also want to add a bit of spice. By that I mean
that it's helpful to come up with ways to not fall into a rut of only
reading and listening to the same stuff all the time. Not only might you
not find out cool things, if you don't work at it, you won't ever come
across stuff that you disagree with, which will make you dumber than you
could be. Farnam street has a great post explaining the author Haruki
Murakami's point of making sure ["not to read what everyone else is
reading"](https://fs.blog/2013/04/reading-what-everyone-else-is-reading/).
The tough bit here is striking a balance between "this input shows me
new and interesting stuff I wouldn't have found otherwise", and "this
input is too far outside of my interests."

For me, the very best sources are idiosyncratic polymaths with wide
interests. Folks like [Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org), [Tyler
Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/) and [Scott
Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com). Eric S. Raymond is mainly a
hacker, Tyler Cowen an economist, and Scott Alexander a psychiatrist,
but my best-loved posts from each have little to do with their day job.
Raymond is an insightful and provocative commentator on society and
politics, Cowen has rather refined tastes in art, and Alexander has
written some of the best history book reviews I've ever read - and this
list is far from exhaustive.

Next best is to find some kind of outlet, like a blog or a podcast or a
youtube channel, that brings in folks from many fields, but that you
find interesting, even when you don't care about whatever field they're
talking about that day. For me, Tim Ferriss was my first taste of this
in [podcast form](https://tim.blog/podcast/), Farnam Street's [Knowledge
Project](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/) is another great one, and
[Unmistakable Creative](https://unmistakablecreative.com/) grabs my
interest a bit less often, but is shorter, which is great for "I just
want to find names and titles to follow up on".

The last is less of a specific tool and more of a mindset: make it a
habit to every once and a while pick up something you wouldn't normally.
Read nothing but business books and practical psychology? Give biology a
try. Are you all STEM, all the time? Try a novel. One of the most
gratifying books I've read in the past few years was [*The Hidden Life
of
Trees*](https://smile.amazon.com/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate-Discoveries-Secret-ebook/dp/B01C9116AK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1593732866&sr=8-2)
- it cured me of a lifetime boredom with botany and helped me to better
understand concepts I thought I had a good handle on, like systems
thinking and evolution.

## Sifting Out What to Work On

Okay, so you've got a reading list several pages long, and RSS feeds of
great blogs out the yin-yang, so what do you do with all this stuff?
Unluckily, none of us can read/listen to/watch/learn everything we find
interesting, so we have to find the stuff worth digging into and set
aside the rest (for now, at least). I have a few rules of thumb to deal
with my own tendency to want to LEARN ALL THE THINGS: ask whether a
source is for information or understanding, choose something you find
interesting over something you feel obliged to read/listen to/watch,
pick long over short, go for old over new, and strike the right balance
between depth and breadth.

### Does This Work Build Your Information or Understanding?

I picked up a handy way to split up your reading from *How to Read a
Book* - are you reading something for *information* or for
*understanding*? Reading for information is when you only try to put
more facts into your head. Reading for understanding, on the other hand,
has the goal of learning to think about new things and in new ways than
you could before reading. It's ready enough to grasp what each of these
mean, but it can be a little tough to sort out in practice, and
sometimes the same book will blend the two.

For example, [The Horse, the Wheel, and
Language](https://smile.amazon.com/Horse-Wheel-Language-Bronze-Age-Eurasian-ebook/dp/B003TSEL1Y/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=horse+wheel+and+language&qid=1595354757&sr=8-1)
links together archaeological, linguistic, and historical evidence to
make a case for the start, growth, and spread of the folks who spoke
Proto-Indo-European and its daughter languages. Since this is a topic
that I like and know something about, for me, much of the book was
information - I knew most of the broad strokes, but I learned a lot more
of the nitty-gritty of where and when developments like the
domestication of the horse or the invention of the wheel took place and
what archaeological techniques let us figure that out. So all of that
was *information*. On the other hand, I came to have a greater
understanding of how archaeology could be applied and some of the
questions that can and can't be answered by it with modern methods, and
how other fields can give greater confidence to archaeological
interpretations, all of which was *understanding*.

### Learn Out of Interest, Not Since You "Ought To"

The next thing to keep in mind is that it's better to learn things you
find interesting than things you think you "should" learn. Of course,
there's a place for pushing yourself to learn things that don't grab you
right away, but that's much harder to do when you're learning on your
own than it is with some kind of help, like a class or book club. Even
though sometimes you'll have to slog, in the long haul, keeping up the
inner drive to learn means more than any one thing you might learn, no
matter how worthwhile.

If you're still thinking of something weighty that you want to learn but
so far hasn't grabbed you, I've got good news. Sometimes you only need
to learn a few things before the rest of the field becomes interesting.
For me, I knew that there must be something to classic literature for so
many folks to speak well of it, but I found it wholly boring. I could
see that it was well-written, but I didn't care - it was just a bunch of
normal folks having feelings and doing dumb things. Who wants that when
you can read about amazing futures or fantastic worlds that never were?
Well, after reading some Carl Jung and listening to/reading a fair
amount of Jordan Peterson, I learned enough about the psychology being
explored in literary fiction to feel like giving it a shot. Surprising
no one more than me, I found myself not only appreciating, but genuinely
enjoying works like *Crime and Punishment*. So, if you have banged your
head against some field that you believe is worthwhile, but you can't
help but find it boring, don't beat yourself up. You might just need to
learn a handful of other things before it opens itself up to you as
something you truly *want* to learn.

Besides keeping your drive to learn going, following your interest gives
you a pretty finely tuned tool for "what my whole brain thinks will be
worthwhile". I learned this from [*Why Greatness Cannot Be
Planned*](https://smile.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective-ebook-dp-B00X57B4JG/dp/B00X57B4JG/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1595356214).
It turns out that what we feel as "interest" is the blended output of
our brain's motivational systems, both conscious and subconscious, which
take in a lot information we might not be aware of and point us toward
things that seem likely to be worthwhile. Following your interest is
most worthwhile when you are trying to get to truly new insights - since
you don't even know what end of your path looks like, you can't set a
goal and shoot for it. Instead, you can take heed of what grabs you,
learn more about that, and then see what new things to learn that opens
up. You keep following these "stepping stones" until they take you
somewhere you couldn't have foreseen, and that's how you come up with
new insights.

Now, if you're like me, and your natural inclination is already to leap
from one interest to the next all nimbly-bimbly, you might have the
opposite problem: you have *too many* things that grab you. If you
follow too many interests, you might never learn anything deep about any
of them. We'll talk more below about striking a balance between breadth
and depth, but when it comes to picking what specific things to learn
and which to set aside, I find it helpful to focus on what I'm *getting*
to learn more about rather than what I *ought* to learn.

### Pick Longer Works Over Shorter

If you want to settle between two things you might read/listen to/watch,
one good rule of thumb is to pick the longer work over the shorter. Read
a book before a blog, a blog before a stand-alone article, an article
before a short clip, and anything before twitter. It's not that more
words make something better. Rather, it's that longer things take more
time and work, which helps to weed out the lazier and less
thought-through ideas. In the past, longer stuff also had to pass
through more gatekeepers, which meant that *somebody* thought it was
worthwhile. There are fewer and fewer gatekeepers these days (for good
and ill), but as readily as anyone can put out a book, it's still harder
than throwing up a post on Facebook. Keep in mind, though, that this
rule works like [Occam's Razor](https://fs.blog/2019/10/occams-razor/) -
don't follow this rule when other evidence overrides it. Pithiness is
the strength of some short works, and some works are longer than they
ought to be - I'm looking at you, business books.

### Old Works Are Likely Better Than New

All other things being the same, something old that folks still think
and talk about is more likely to be worthwhile than new stuff. The ["The
Lindy Effect"](https://fs.blog/2013/08/choose-your-next-book/) sums up
why, which says that for non-living things like books or ideas, the
longer they've been around so far, the longer they're likely to still be
around going forward. This seems backwards until you think about it a
bit. The *Iliad* was likely written down sometime in the 700s BCE (after
an oral tradition stretching even farther back). Since then, there have
been *a lot* of new things to read, and yet we still read it. In the
roughly 2,700 years in between, every time someone said "should I copy
the *Iliad* or *Ye Newwe Hotnesse*", they went with the *Iliad*. Every
time someone could only grab a few precious handfuls of books as their
library burned down, the *Iliad* was on that list. In other words, the
*Iliad* (and other old works) have lived through a lot of evolutionary
selection to make it to today. There's been a lot of time to find what's
wrong with it, to get bored with it, or to move on to something new. The
very fact that those things haven't happened makes it more likely that
you too will find something worthwhile in that work. Clearly there are
limits to this rule - for one, some interesting stuff won't have old
works about it (like like blockchain or nanotechnology), but even where
old works are not specifically about the topic, you might be surprised
how often the insights and understanding old works bring you can be
brought to bear on very new things.

### Know When to Seek Depth and When Breadth

You may have seen that unlike the last few bits, this one does not say
that either depth or breadth is better than the other. Instead, you need
to strike a good balance between them. You may have heard the thought of
["T-Shaped Folks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), which
says it is best to have some breadth of skills, but to have deep
knowledge in one or a few. Though I like this framework and believe in
it, I have to say that I struggle a lot with this one. By nature, I lean
pretty strongly toward breadth, as every time I hear out about some new
field, it becomes the thing that grips me for awhile. Breadth has much
going for it: it lets you make links between fields, bring over insights
from one field to another, and see things from more than one point of
view. Further, knowledge that you can use across many fields is more
often helpful than knowledge that only works in one field.

That being said, we have a word for someone who's all breadth and no
depth: "dilettante". If you never take the time to get some depth
somewhere, you won't learn anything truly worthwhile, and you won't have
anything new or weighty to say about *any* field. If you can make
yourself (and I know it's hard\!), you're better off going deep in one
field at a time, then on to the next to go deep there, and so on, rather
than shallowly flitting from one field to the next.

## Working Over the Stuff You Pick

You've carefully picked out a work to build your knowledge, one that's
likely to grab you but still push you a bit, and it's the right age,
length, and depth - so what do you do with it? As you read, listen, or
watch, you need to do more than sit there and enjoy the ride. You need
to think about it, find links to other things you know, and bring it to
bear on your life. I tend to do most of my learning through reading, as
that's what works for me, so that's what I mostly talk about below. That
being said, if you have thoughts about how to get more out of podcasts,
videos, or other kinds of works, I would love to hear about it.

### Kinds of Reading

So, funny story about me and reading. When my folks were teaching me how
to read, I was not into it at all. I had a very reasonable objection:
"why should I learn to read when Mom reads to me?" Well, as you might be
able to tell, I got over that way of thinking pretty quick, and ever
since, I've been what you might politely call "a pretty big reader." For
most of my life, though, I didn't use any kind of frameworks or ways of
working when I read, other than scattered notes every now and again -
instead, I leaned on having a pretty good memory and reading a lot. As
I've gotten older, though, I've found that some things I once knew have
grown fuzzy or wholly fallen out of my head. So, in the last few years,
I've gotten into, some might say "obsessed by", frameworks and ways of
reading meant to help you get more out of it.

####  Mindful Reading is the Key to Getting More Out of Books
    
First off, all of these ways of reading are *mindful*. They ask you
to think and do things as you go, not to sit idly by and let the
words wash over you. So, even if none of the below grab you, you can
still read better by finding ways to be more mindful that work for
you. That might be as quick as jotting down any questions or other
books a passage makes you think of. With only a bit more work, you
can remember much more of what you read by [writing a rundown of
each chapter as you finish reading it](https://fs.blog/2013/11/taking-notes-while-reading/).

####  Inspectional, Analytical, and Syntopical Reading Let You Work at Different Levels
    
[*How to Read a
    Book*](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Touchstone-ebook/dp/B004PYDAPE/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1595962509&sr=8-2)
by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren is one of those books that I
deeply wish I had known about when I was younger, yet I wonder if I
would have gotten as much out of it then as I have now. The key
insight of the book is that "reading" is an overly broad word. It
covers everything from merely knowing what sounds squiggles on paper
make all the way up to working through a pile of weighty works,
understanding the threads between them, and coming up with new
insights therefrom.
    
Adler and Van Doren put forth a framework for reading that splits it
into "Elementary", "Inspectional", "Analytical", and "Syntopical". "Elementary
Reading" is what you learned to do in elementary school - look at symbols on a
page or screen and understand them as language. We won't go further into that
here, as you clearly have it down if you are *reading a blog post*. Instead,
let's dive into the more helpful bits of their framework.
    
##### Inspectional Reading Gets the Most You Can in a Short Time
        
You might call inspectional reading "smart skimming", or
"skimming with an end in mind". Skimming gets a bad rap. I know
that for years I looked down my oh-so-well-read nose at "mere"
skimming as something for dummies and book-hating monsters.
Thankfully, *How to Read a Book* smacked that dim-witted thought
right out of my head. Yes, if you *only* skim, you're never
going to learn much, but skimming when you should and doing it
well adds *so much* to your reading.
       
Some books only need to be skimmed - you pick up the outline of
the argument, some key facts, and you have what you need (see
above about reading for interest vs information). Skimming
others will tell you that it might be great for you one day, but
you're not ready for it today. Or you might find you only truly
need to read one chapter in great depth right now. Sometimes
you'll skim and find yourself getting pulled in, and you'll know
"I need to read this in depth right now\!" The key is that there
is no "one size fits all" answer for which books to skim and
when - it will depend on you, your needs, and your current
knowledge.
        
Skimming is the tool that lets you make smarter decisions about
what to read and how much work to put into it. If you stick with
"I read every book word-for-word and cover-to-cover" like I did
for so long (and honestly still slip into sometimes), you'll
find yourself reading stuff that bores you, or worse, putting
down a book when you could have gotten something from it with a
skim.
        
So, how do you do it? Go through the following steps, and if at
any of them you feel you've gotten what you want/need out of
this book, or like it's not for you, then *stop*. You can always
come back later. Don't keep going if you think a book is a waste
of time, boring, or unhelpful, but also don't keep going if you
feel like you've "got it". Even if you go through all the steps,
once you know how to do it, it shouldn't take you more than an
hour or so.
        
1.  First, read everything on the cover and in the jacket (or
    its equivalent in the Amazon description) - title, subtitle,
    advertising blurb, summary, and so forth. All of this gives
    you an overall look at what the book is about. Don't be shy
    about reading summaries on Good Reads or the like - spoilers
    only count for fiction.
2.  Next, read the foreword/preface/introduction. This gives you
    a better idea about whether the book does what you hope it
    does, and often gives you a summary of the overall argument
    and conclusion.
3.  After that, read the table of contents to get a look at the
    shape of the overall argument in more detail. You might also
    skim through the index to get a feel for what words and
    folks come up in the book.
4.  Finally, skim through the book, stopping at the bits most
    likely to be useful - the opening and closing paragraphs of
    chapters, beginning and endings of paragraphs, and the
    closing chapter. You can dip in here and there in more
    detail if something grabs you, but try to keep it quick.
        
Again, if after any of the steps above (even the first one) you
find either that the book doesn't grab you or that you've
learned what you wanted out of it, *stop*. You're through,
mission accomplished. On the other hand, if you get through all
four steps and feel like there's more you want to grapple with,
you can go onto an analytical reading (see below).
        
I have also found a middle way, when my skimming has shown me
that a book has some worthwhile stuff, but I don't want to dig
in to a full analytical reading. When I find myself with such a
book, I'll write a one to two sentence rundown for each chapter
(as far as I can tell from the skim). This way, if I ever come
back, or if I need to refresh myself on something this book
says, I can pick and choose the bits that will help me the most.
        
If you don't pick up anything else from the *How to Read a Book*
way of doing things, please settle on some way of making smart
skimming one of the tools in your toolbox. It not only helps you
better pick which books to read more deeply, it makes that
deeper reading better by showing you the overall shape of the
book and how its bits fit together.
    
##### Analytical Reading Takes the Time You Need to Get Everything You Can
        
When you need to call in the big guns, like when you're
wrestling with the [western canon](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/120742.Mortimer_J_Adler_s_reading_list)
and you want to truly *understand* them and squeeze them for all
they're worth, that's when you go to "analytical reading". This
is likely the kind of thing that comes to mind when you see a
huge nerdy post about ways to learn better.
        
1.  Step one is to do an inspectional read like we talked about
    above.
2.  After you have the overall structure, try to identify key
    terms - concepts that seem core to the main idea of the
    book.
3.  Then look for the author's main propositions - what is he or
    she putting forth as being true?
4.  Then look for how these propositions are linked together and
    built out by arguments.
5.  Once you feel like you understand what the author is asking
    you to believe is true, and have a fair idea of how they've
    backed that up, ask yourself if they've done enough, and why
    or why not. You need to be very careful here, and to keep in
    mind our [inborn leaning to not change our minds
    readily](https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/), but
    this will really help you work out if you've understood what
    you read.

##### Syntopical Reading Gets What No Lone Book Can Give You
        
        Most folks who aren't academics never truly get into this kind
        of reading, but it is rewarding when you stick with it. It very
        much takes time and thinking, though, so it's more of a tool for
        depth than for breadth.
        
        1.  First, you work out a rough shape of what it is you want to
            learn more about. If you already have a very specific idea,
            awesome, but if not, no worries, that will take shape as you
            work through the next steps.
        2.  Next you come up with a draft list of books and articles
            that you think *might* help you learn more about your chosen
            topic. Err on the side of going wide with this list, as it
            will be easier to take things off than put them on.
        3.  Then, do an inspectional read of each work on the list to
            see which ones are helpful, which aren't, and which have
            bits that might be helpful. You'll likely take off many
            books and articles from the list at this point, but you
            might also add a few that your inspectional read has helped
            you find. From the helpful ones, work up your final list.
        4.  After that, work out the key terms from each of the works on
            your list. Where you can see that different authors use
            different words to mean the same thing, settle on one term
            to use to translate between them. If you're not sure, dig in
            to learn what the distinctions between terms might be.
        5.  From there, look for what questions are common between all
            or most of the authors - what are they trying to answer?
            What concerns do all of them talk about? What areas of life
            do they write about?
        6.  Then work out what answers they put forward, looking most of
            all where different writers give different answers to the
            same questions. Hold off as long as you can from picking any
            side and lay out each answer and what the authors use to get
            to them. At this point, your goal is not to discover whether
            one side or the other is right, but to build up a true
            picture of the field and its debate. You may at some point
            find one set of arguments more convincing, but hold off on
            making judgment as long as you can stand it. This makes for
            a great excuse to work on some [probabilistic
            thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/05/probabilistic-thinking/) -
            give each position a weight based on its evidence, and if
            that doesn't agree with your intuition, ask yourself why.

#### "Reading Fat" Grounds a Work
    
    "Reading Fat" is a thought I came across in [*The Creative
    Habit*](https://smile.amazon.com/Creative-Habit-Learn-Use-Life-ebook/dp/B000SEOWBG/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1596215137&sr=8-4)
    by Twyla Tharpe. In some ways it is like syntopical reading, but in
    others it is its inverse. As with syntopical reading, you read many
    works with a common thread between them. Unlike syntopical reading,
    where the thing holding together the works is a topic or field, in
    "reading fat", the link is a main work that you want to understand
    deeply. Twyla Tharpe is a playwright and choreographer, so it makes
    sense that she wants to get to know that one work *very* well to
    make a show based on it. For most of us, I'm not sure how many works
    will truly call for this approach, but it seems to meet the needs of
    creative endeavors rather well, such as if you were drawing insight
    for writing a book or making art. If you've ever sought out books
    since a favorite author recommended them or named them as
    inspirations, then you have read "fat".
    
    Set beside the other methods, though it is a lot of work, this one
    is pretty easy to lay out.
    
    1.  First, pick a book, movie, play, piece of music, or whatever
        other work.
    2.  Then try to find as much stuff linked to it as you can and check
        it out yourself. This might take some digging - not everyone has
        given a helpful talk where they list influences or best-loved
        works. Look for things the maker alluded to in their work. Was
        the maker part of a "scene" or "movement" or "subgenre"? Check
        out other works from that grouping. Look for stuff from the same
        time. Look for stuff that they might have been reacting
        *against*. Look for reviews, commentaries, and critiques on the
        work, look for folks who were themselves influenced by the work.
    
    If you play "telephone" long enough, you could likely link about
    anything to your starting work, so you'll have to use some wisdom on
    where to stop. It can be very helpful to have some end you're
    working toward - *why* do you want to get to know this work so
    deeply? Are you making something of your own with it? Do you want to
    understand its influence on others? Your answer will help you know
    when you're still digging up worthwhile stuff and when you're just
    linking things for the sake linking them.

##### Incremental Reading Brings In Spaced Repetition
    
    If you're ready to go *full reading dork*, "Incremental Reading" is
    here for you. We're going to talk a lot about ["Spaced
    Repetition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) in the
    next bit of this series, but the short version is that you can use
    software that will take a flashcard of something you're trying to
    learn (like a foreign word or historical date) and then calculate
    how long it should wait before it shows you the same card again to
    best build long-term memory. Well, the guy who pioneered spaced
    repetition systems for learning, [Piotr
    Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak) came up with a
    way to apply the same algorithm to reading, and he calls it
    [Incremental
    Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading).
    
    When I first read about this, the thought of giving it a try gripped
    me strongly. It turns out that the only fully built-out way to do
    incremental reading is with Wozniak's own program
    [SuperMemo](https://super-memo.com/supermemo84.html), so I decided
    to give it a try. I ended up not really being able to get the hang
    of it. For one, SuperMemo runs only on Windows, so I had to put a
    new partition on my Mac to install Windows. Then I bought the
    program and fired it up, and well, I just couldn't make it work for
    me. I could look past "closed source", I could look past "design
    from the Windows XP era", I could even look past "hard to learn",
    but I couldn't handle all of those put together. So I threw in the
    towel and looked for other options. That led me to learn
    [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which is a whole
    rabbit hole of its own, but one that's been more helpful. I still
    haven't gotten a set up for incremental reading working the way I
    want it to, but I'm getting close. I share all this as a bit of a
    warning: incremental reading has a high barrier to entry even just
    to try it out.
    
    Okay, so how do you actually do incremental reading?
    
    1.  The main idea is that you read a little bit of a book or article
        at a time, whenever the spaced repetition algorithm brings it
        up.
    2.  Each time it pops up, you read a little bit, and you look for
        what you most want to learn. You mark the important stuff, like
        with a highlight, and then that highlighted stuff becomes its
        own "flashcard" to be shown by the spaced repetition system.
    3.  Over time, you can archive stuff that you don't need any more,
        and it will only show you the highlighted excerpts, which you
        can further break down as you go.
    4.  If something ever pops up that you don't recognize, you can
        trace back where it came from to get the context you need.
    
    Supermemo has a lot of other little features that make it work
    better, and it integrates very cleanly into using spaced repetition
    for flashcards (see the next post). It's a bit hard to get a grip on
    what it is from a brief description, so if you'd like to read more,
    Wozniak has a lengthy [write
    up](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning) and lots
    of
    [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqmYtieCc3liSTYxLwk_MLw)
    demonstrating how it works.
    
    For me, incremental reading still grips me as something that I think
    will be very helpful once I'm able to get it working, but it might
    be that it's not worth the up-front outlay of time and work to get
    it going - my non-fiction reading has slowed to a crawl the past six
    months or so as I've been hung up on trying to get an incremental
    reading system working, so check it out at your own risk.

#### Speed Reading is a Narrow Tool
    
    Lastly, I wanted to say a quick word on speed reading. In college, I
    taught myself to speed read to get through a class that handed out a
    book a week of primary sources from Anglo-Saxon England (translated
    into Modern English, thank goodness\!). While I held onto enough to
    do well in the class, it never truly felt like it "stuck" and it
    always felt like a chore. So I didn't keep it up. Well, a few years
    on and I'm getting into the learning stuff we're talking about in
    this series and I come across some
    [different](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/03/13/reading-faster/)
    [opinions](https://markmanson.net/read-faster) on [speed
    reading](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-how-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-1/).
    
    My current thinking is that speed reading can be helpful, but only
    in one or two fairly narrow ways. For one, the techniques of speed
    reading, like eliminating subvocalizations or using a finger/pointer
    to keep pace, can help you to read a *little* faster without going
    full-on "speed reading". For two, something closer to true speed
    reading can be helpful when doing a smart skim, as laid out above -
    it's definitely better than only reading some of the words you skim
    through, and almost as fast. So, instead of trying to make speed
    reading "the way you read", you can decide to use speed reading
    techniques as one tool in your toolbox.

### Kinds of Note Taking

Whatever way you read/listen/watch something, if you want to get the
most out of it, you'll need to take some notes. I long put off adding
this skill to my toolbox, for I thought I could get away with having a
pretty good memory. Going back to stuff that I "learned" without notes,
though, has been a harsh lesson. I am shocked by how little I recall,
most of all when I set that beside how much comes back to me from books
where I took even a few notes. Good notes really let you make a work
your own, and you'll get more out of it in the long run.

#### The Techniques Below Build on Overall Note-Taking Principles

All of the methods below share some common principles. The first is
to *get everything down first and worry about what to keep from it
later*. This follows the [Getting Things Done
(GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) way of separating input from
processing. The next rule is to write in *your own words*. Thinking
of your own way to say a thought pushes you to better understand it
and make it your own. Even when using electronic methods, be careful
with copying and pasting. Third, *find links with things you already
know*. Making these links is how your knowledge grows into a
framework you can use in many ways and in many fields. Lastly,
*write down the date*. This one is a bit more tactical, but it helps
you put the thing in context and understand what you knew and were
thinking at the time.

#### "Thoughts After Reading" is a Lightweight 80/20 Habit
    
If you've had trouble either starting or keeping a habit of taking
notes on what you read, "Thoughts After Reading" is a lightweight,
easy-to-stick-with technique. I learned this from a mentor of mine,
and I'm not sure if it's his own or from somewhere else. The way to
do it is straightforward: when you get to the end of a book (or
article or podcast, if you like), write down a paragraph of so about
it: the main point, what you got out of it, and what other works it
brought to mind. Some folks will find it helpful to put this
somewhere they can share with others, like
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). This may not be the most
thorough way to work over a book, but it *is* one that you can keep
doing readily. As Tim Ferriss has said many time, it's better to do
the [okay thing you stick with than the great thing you
don't](https://tim.blog/podcast/).

#### End of Chapter/Section Summaries Help You Hold Onto What You Read
    
This [method](https://fs.blog/2013/11/taking-notes-while-reading/)
is recommended by Farnam Street, and is also easy to do. At the end
of every chapter (or section, if you're feeling thorough), write
down a summary in your own words. Try to do it from memory first,
then skim through the chapter to see if you missed anything. You can
highlight or write in the margins, but you don't have to. I like
this way of note taking best as a way to strengthen inspectional
reading. When I read for information, a brief summary of each
chapter based on a skim is often all I will ever need. If I do
decide to come back and dig deeper, the summaries point me right
where I need to go.

#### Progressive Summarization Gives "Just In Time" Analysis
    
Thiago Forte has a course on building your own knowledge set up
called ["Building a Second
Brain"](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/). I have not checked
out the course, but I have learned a lot from his
[articles](https://fortelabs.co/blog/), and the concept I have found
most interesting is ["progressive
summarization"](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes).
The thought is that you read something interesting or helpful, store
it somewhere you can find it (like Ever note), and then each time
you go back to it, you do a *little* more work. The main thing to
keep in mind is that you don't follow the steps below on a schedule
or on every thing you ever read - you only go to the next step when
you have some reason to come back to the reading. Here's an example
of what that might look like with an article:
    
1.  On the first pass, save it somewhere like Evernote, and then as
    you read, bold all the bits that seem interesting or useful
2.  Next time you come back to the article , highlight the *most*
    important parts in the bolded stuff
3.  On a third pass, you summarize the article in your own words
4.  On a fourth pass, incorporate the thoughts from the article into
    some work of your own (like a blog post)
    
The key thought is that you only do each step *as needed*, when you
come back to the material naturally. You don't ever highlight or
summarize "just in case". This makes sure that you don't waste any
work and that you do your summarization in the context of a real
project or problem that you're thinking through.
    
Whether you follow the above step-by-step or not, I think the two
most useful concepts are the idea of keeping your "notes" withing
their context (you can always read the not-bold bits, they're right
there), and having a "just in time" or "on demand" approach to
working through your notes. This last one is most helpful if, like
me, you find yourself organizing and categorizing for its own sake,
rather than staying focused on the true output of projects.

#### The Cornell Method is Great for Lectures and Meetings
    
The [Cornell
Method](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/)
was, unsurprisingly, thought up at the university of the same name.
They worked it out to help struggling college students get a handle
on lecture-based teaching instead of the textbook focus they knew
from high school. You can find handy
[templates](https://templatelab.com/cornell-notes/) online, or just
draw some lines on paper. I find it most helpful for things that are
mostly listening and where the structure isn't clear ahead of time,
like a meeting, lecture, or youtube video. Here's how you do it.
    
1.  First, at the top of the page, write the name/topic and any
    other administrative details (like date, client, project, class,
    or what have you). Put a line across the whole page under this
    to mark off the header.
    
2.  Next, divide most of the page into two columns: a narrower one
on the left, and a wider one on the right. a. The one on the
right is where you'll write your "raw" notes as you go. Write
down whatever you think might be important, questions you might
want to ask, follow-ups, actions, and so forth. Most of the
time, I don't recommend trying to get a verbatim transcript -
it's not hard to do and not helpful most of the time. b. If your
notes go for more than one page, leave room for the top portion
(and add page numbers), and keep up with the two columns. c.
Also think about putting in sketches and diagrams to help you
understand things. d. The smaller left column is for *after* the
lecture/video/meeting. Go back and look through the notes in the
right column, and as you go, add labels and summaries to mark
what's important, show links between sections, highlight open
questions or action items, and make clear the structure of how
things fit together.
    
3.  Lastly, on the last page of your notes, put another line across
the page and use the bottom of the page for a rundown of what's
covered above. Here, you can put things in a new order, make
terms more consistent, use your own language to get things to
make sense, and boil down to what matters most. Once you have
this rundown, when you are looking over your notes, you only
need to go back to the body of your notes if something in the
rundown confuses you. Then you can use the labels in the left
hand column to find the full notes in the right column that will
help.
    
As I said, this is a flexible way to work, but I find it most
helpful when the structure isn't very clear from the start. Since
books have tables of contents and section headers and such, I don't
often need the Cornell Method for them, but for meetings or
presentations, it is very helpful.

#### The Slipbox Gives You Building Blocks for Writing
    
One of the most exciting note-taking methods I've come across has
been the ["Slipbox"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).
The German sociologist Niklas Luhmann came up with it to help him
write more than 70 books and over 400 scholarly articles (no, those
aren't extra zeroes). The slipbox helps folks put down their
thoughts on what they read and finding insights by putting those
thoughts together, with the end goal of sharing those insights
through writing. In other words, it is most helpful for writers and
academics.
    
The overall thought is to do a little bit of reading, thinking, and
writing every day. You break out getting things down, working them
over, and finding links between them into their own steps. All of
this happens on "slips", so called because the original method was
literally postcard-sized slips of paper in a box. Later, when you
want to write, you find the notes that work, put them together, and
edit.
    
I learned about this way of working from the book [*How to Take
Smart
Notes*](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes&qid=1596556217&sr=8-2)
by Sonke Ahrens. Of all the ways of taking notes in this post, I've
worked with this one the most. There is a lot of wisdom in how it's
put together, and I've gotten a lot out of it, but my current way of
doing it has a bit more
[friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz) than
would be best. I'm hoping that by setting forth how it works below,
I'll get a better understanding of what makes it tick, and how best
to tune it.
    
##### Get Down Whatever Grabs You on Fleeting Slips
        
As you read, take notes in whatever way is quick and easy for
you - paper notebook, note-taking [app](https://1writerapp.com/)
on your phone, super-fast plain text
[program](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/), or what
have you. These are called fleeting slips, and they live in your
inbox (another GTD-inspired method). Right now, I'm using
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the extension
[Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/), but as I said above, that's
it's own can of worms, so I can't truly recommend it only for a
slipbox. Anyhow, the main thing for these fleeting slips is that
it's fast and easy to get them down and you can find them when
you come back to do more with them.
    
#####  Lasting Slips Build Emergent Structure
        
Speaking of doing more with those fleeting slips, the next step
is to go through your fleeting thoughts and work them into
lasting slips. Look through the slips in your inbox and ask
whether each ought to get more time and thought. Sometimes the
stuff we write down seems weighty at the time, but with
hindsight turns out not to be so helpful. You can get rid of
those. The ones that are worthwhile, though, you work up into
lasting slips. Give each slip a unique ID of some kind. Luhmann
alternated between numbers and letters, something like 12a3b2.
In this set up, switching between numbers and letters showed the
level of nesting of linked topics. Many electronic set ups
recommend using a date-time string (like 202006121014) since
they are sure to be unique and can be readily created by your
computer. I find the organization of Luhmann's method helpful,
so I follow that for my Slip ID, but I use the date string for
my fleeting thoughts, so that they'll sort cleanly.
        
In writing out your slip, write down the thought in your own
words, as if someone else about it so that they understand. You
try to keep to "one thought, one slip", and you note any links
to other slips already in your slip box. If you're working
electronically, you can use a tagging system and/or put in
hyperlinks to the other slips, but as long as you have the
unique ID of the other slip, you'll be able to find your way to
it.
        
As we went along, you may have marked the lack of any talk about
categorization or organization. Instead, an *emergent* structure
makes itself known to you as you go along. I very much like this
way of going about things, as it makes the slipbox outstanding
for finding links between unalike fields and drawing insights
therefrom.
    
##### Put Lasting Slips Together to Write
        
Once you have a number of lasting slips, you will hopefully
start to see threads running through them that spur your own
insights. These threads give you the bones of your own writing.
To turn slips into a paper or blog post or the like, you make a
project folder or file and then copy the slips that have bearing
on the main idea into it. With these slips in the project file,
you're never dealing with the "blank page" problem, which makes
it much easier to deal with writer's block. You put the slips in
a rough order, write anything needed to link them together, and
then start editing. By keeping up the habit of reading and
writing a bit every day, you never have to sit down and write
*everything* for a big paper, article, or blog post. Instead
it's only one more incremental, manageable step.

## Closing

This has been a long post and we've gone over a lot of stuff - how to
find sources of interesting stuff, how to sift through to find what will
help you most, and how to work through the stuff you do pick. If you're
like me, you might be fired up by all these cool ideas. Or maybe it all
looks daunting, and you're feeling overwhelmed. However you're feeling,
the best thing to do is to start small, try one or two new things at a
time, and keep whatever works. I've been messing around with this
learning stuff for years, and I'm still working it all out - hence this
series. The other thing to keep in mind is that as we go through the
rest of the series is that all of the bits work on and with each other.
For example, what you want to do with the knowledge you learn will shape
how you hold on to it and how to bring it in. Next time, we'll talk
about the ways you might hang on to the knowledge you've brought in and
how to pull it up.
